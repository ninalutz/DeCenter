                        <p class="lead">“Reproductive Justice”, introduced by SisterSong, states: “the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities”. This has been co-opted and abused by politics, adoption, and childcare complexes under racialized capitalism.</p>

                        <h4>Reproductive Justice</h4>
                        <p class = "lead">How has the grounds of reproductive justice changed over time? What social performances are now demanded of those who wish to parent? How are the historical trends still appearing today?</p>

                        <h4>Adoption</h4>
                        <p class="lead">Adoption can be a beautiful way to give children loving homes who may not have one. But some adoptions can lead to trauma for multiple parties. How can this be held all at once? Additionally, in a world where transracial and international adoption have been more possible and popular, how do we balance good intentions with families that want a white savior aesthetic?
                        </p>

                        <h4>Childfree</h4>
                        <p class="lead">
                            More and more individuals are choosing to be childfree. To what extent for many cases is this a choice? In the case of individuals who want children but cannot biologically, and may not be able to afford adoption, where does this leave them? What is the current aesthetic of childfree -- who do you most associate this lifestyle with?
                        </p>
